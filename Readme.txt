To Start the autoclicker, run "autoclicker.py" then input the number you want and
press enter when prompted.
The autoclicker should start within a few seconds.

Note: In order for the autoclicker to work as is, your screen resolution needs to
be 1366x768(to find your screen resolution just take a screenshot and open it). If
you have any other resolution you will need to change the x and y values in all
the corresponding files for them to work properly.
